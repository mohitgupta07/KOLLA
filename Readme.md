Introduction
Welcome to the repository! This project is designed to help you get started quickly with Kolla. This guide will walk you through the initial setup steps to get your development environment up and running smoothly.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

Docker (for containerization)
Docker Compose (for managing multi-container Docker applications)
Node.js (with npm, Node.js package manager)
Setup Instructions
To get the project up and running, follow these steps:

1. Build and Start Containers
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Why This Command?
This command is crucial for setting up your Docker environment.

docker-compose up: This command starts your application in a Docker environment using the configuration defined in the docker-compose.yml file. It ensures that all the necessary services (like databases, web servers, etc.) are started in their respective containers.

--build: This flag forces Docker to rebuild the images before starting the containers. It's especially useful when you've made changes to the Dockerfile or any of the dependencies that your services rely on. By rebuilding, you ensure that your containers are up-to-date with the latest changes.

2. Clear npm Cache

```
npm cache clean --force
```

Why This Command?
Over time, the npm cache can accumulate outdated or corrupted files, which might cause issues during installation of packages.

npm cache clean --force: This command clears the npm cache by force, removing any cached data that could potentially interfere with the installation of your projectâ€™s dependencies. This step helps ensure that you start with a clean slate, reducing the risk of errors related to corrupted or outdated packages.

3. Update npm to the Latest Version

```
npm install -g npm
```
Why This Command?
Keeping your npm version up-to-date is important for several reasons:

Bug Fixes: Newer versions of npm come with important bug fixes that can resolve issues in package installation, dependency management, and more.

Security Patches: npm releases often include security updates that protect your project from vulnerabilities in the package management process.

New Features: Updating npm allows you to take advantage of new features and performance improvements.

Running npm install -g npm ensures that you are using the latest version of npm globally, reducing the chances of encountering issues with outdated npm versions.
